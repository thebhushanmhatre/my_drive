I hope these Instructions Helped.

Some Personal notes to myself and others could make use of the same.

If you get any error, 
Just Google it, 
And let Stack-overflow show you the way.

Never be hesitant of looking for Google for resolving errors,
Just Make sure that once you resolve any error through 'googling it',
Next time when you get the Same Error, you shouldn't use Google again.
First of all, you should not make the same mistake again to get the same error.
Second, if u made that mistake or let us say you are resolving someone's bug,
then this time you should be able to resolve the issue on your own.

This is how you become better at Coding.
